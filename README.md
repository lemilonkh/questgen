# QuestGen
A procedural quest generator using [Tracery](http://tracery.io/). It builds random quest descriptions that you can use in a RPG oder roguelike style of game (or whereever else).
Future ideas include a markov chain based name generation system and support for the [Godot](https://godotengine.org/) engine (probably via C++ modules or a NodeJS or nw.js based browser solution).
